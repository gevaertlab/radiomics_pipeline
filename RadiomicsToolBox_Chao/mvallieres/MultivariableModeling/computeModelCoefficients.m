% function [coeff,resp,modelCI] = computeModelCoefficients(X,Y,imbalance,seed)
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% DESCRIPTION: 
% This function computes the final model logistic regression coefficients 
% using bootstrap resampling, and it associated multivariable model 
% response and bootstrap confidence intervals. See ref. [1] for more 
% details. This function uses logistic regression utilities from DREES 
% <http://www.cerr.info/drees>, as well as a rounding function written by 
% Francois Beauducel available at: 
% <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26212-round-with-significant-digits>

% INPUTS:
% - X: Matrix of size [nInst X nFeat], specifying the numerical data of the 
%      features of the input features, where 'nInst' refers to the number 
%      of instances in X, and 'nFeat' to the number of features in X. 
%      Each column is a different feature.
% - Y: Column vector of size [nInst X 1] specifying the outcome status 
%      (1 or 0) for all instances.
% - imbalance: String specifying the type of imbalance-adjustement strategy
%              employed. Either 'IABR' for imbalance-adjusted bootstrap
%              resampling (see ref.[1]), or 'IALR' for imbalance-adjusted
%              logistic regression (formal reference to come).
% - seed: (optional input). Numerical number to use as random generator 
%         seed for bootstrapping experiments.
%         --> Ex: 54288
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% OUTPUTS:
% - coeff: Column vector of size [nCoeff+1 X 1] specifying the final 
%          logistic regression coefficients. Last entry specify the offset
%          of the model.
% - resp: Column vector of size [nInst X 1] specifying the linear 
%         multivariable model response when 'coeff' is applied to 'X'.
% - modelCI: Column vector of size [nInst X 2] specifying the 95%
%            confidence interval on the multivariable model response as
%            defined by the 2.5 (modelCI(i,1)) and the 97.5 (modelCI(i,2))
%            percentiles, for the ith instance. See ref. [1] for more 
%            details.
% - coeff_boot: Array of size [nCoeff X 1000], where 1000 is the number of 
%               bootstrap samples used to calculate the mean coefficients 
%               ('coeff' output #1). Each column thus specify the logisitic 
%               regression model coefficients for a particular bootstrap
%               training sample. These set of bootstrap coeffcients could
%               therafter be used to calculate the confidence intervals on
%               predictions in new testing data.

% CALCULATING THE BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF THE FINAL MODEL
for i = 1:size(X,1)
    modelCI(i,1)= prctile(respBoot(i,:),alpha/2*100);

% ROUNDING COEFFICIENTS

% According to their standard errors, as in ref. [1]
% Note: This type of rounding seems too strong and may not be desirable, as it significantly affects the specificity of models
%       --> kept here as comments before further investigations
% for i = 1:order+1
%     if coeff(i) > 0
%         coeff(i) = roundsd(coeff(i),ceil(log10(abs(coeff(i)/roundsd(SE_coeff(i),1)))) + 1);
%     else
%         coeff(i) = roundsd(coeff(i),ceil(log10(abs(coeff(i)/roundsd(SE_coeff(i),1)))));
%     end
% end

% Rounding to 4 significant digits
% --> seems to preserve the predictive properties of models
coeff = roundsd(coeff,4);
