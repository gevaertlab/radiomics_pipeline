--> This package (ref. [1] study: /radiomics/STUDIES/LGG_study>)
    contains 2 folders and 2 files (other than the current README file):

1. 'Functions': MATLAB codes.

2. 'WORKSPACE': Directory where the inputs and outputs of experiments are 
                saved. It should contain 1 folder and 1 file. 
       - TCGA_DATA: Folder containing relevant info for the study.
       - 'masterScript_LGG.m': MATLAB master script to reproduce the 
          experiments of ref. [1].

3. TCGA_clinical_INFO.csv: Clinical information of patients of ref. [1].

4. TCGA_vasari_INFO.csv: VASARI imaging features of patients of ref. [1].


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPORTANT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ROI masks for the study are currently being uploaded on the TCIA website.
The complete code to run and extract textures directly from the imaging
data will be updated in masterScript_LGG.m shortly. In the meantime, please
download pre-computed textures on Google Drive (see instructions below).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the texture data ("TEXTURES_TCGA.zip") on Google Drive: 
   https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0fcZCGXT3nZWXM5d0t3OXVjQzA

2. Extract the downloaded texture file ("TEXTURES_TCGA.zip") and place 
   the resulting "TEXTURES" folder in ../WORKSPACE/TCGA_DATA

3. Set up the MATLAB path to contain all sub-folders of the folder 
   'Functions of this study (ref. [1]), and all sub-folders of the folders 
   'MultivariableModeling', 'NontextureFeatures', 'TextureToolbox' and 
   'Utilities' of the <https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics/> package.
    
4. Run 'masterScript_LGG.m' in MATLAB from the 'WORKSPACE' folder. Expect 
   the whole program to run in about 10 hours using an Intel(R) Core(TM)
   i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50 GHz with 8 cores.



NOTES:

- Over time, some codes have been improved since the initial creation of 
  the results of this study (e.g., better ROI and texture definition). 
  Results may slightly  differ compared to what is found in ref. [1].

- This software code have up to now been tested on a Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) 
  operating system (OS) using Matlab R2015b only. It is expected to run 
  fine on any Unix-based OS, but probably not in Windows due to 
  differences in command line functions. Windows-compatible code is 
  currently a work in progress.
